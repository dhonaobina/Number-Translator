This was my final project that I did with ARA Institute of Canterbury, New Zealand in 2020 through online.
During my studies, I was introduced with GitHub and GitLab but we didn't dig dive on it.
Now, that I am able to work with git and GitHub, I would like to publish more projects with improvements.

This is the Number Translator.
User can enter number from 1 - 30 and will be translated.
As well as, can be heard by user.

I'm looking forward to create projects to showcase my skills as a developer.
This way I can get a developer position where I can contribute my skills and I'm so excited when that time comes.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Account :)
